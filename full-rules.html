    <h2>General Rules</h2>
    <h3>Player Setup</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All players must sit on chairs arranged in a circle or spaced out in an open area.</li>
      <li>Players must remain seated unless specific game mechanics (such as Duos mode) require movement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tissue Type</h3>
    <p>Only Belpak pocket tissues are allowed for fair play. These tissues are light, soft, and designed for easy throwing.</p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Eliminate opponents by hitting them with tissues.</li>
      <li>The last remaining player or duo wins the round.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Elimination</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A player is eliminated if they are hit by a tissue while seated.</li>
      <li>A direct hit (tissue making physical contact with the player) counts as elimination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>No Dodging Rule</h3>
    <p>Players cannot leave their chairs to dodge tissues, ensuring fairness and safety. The only exception is in Duos mode, where players may be required to stand.</p>

  <section id="duos-atcs">
    <h2>Duos ATCS (Partner Mode)</h2>
    <h3>Team Setup</h3>
    <p>Players pair up into duos to compete against other teams. Each duo works together to eliminate other teams and be the last duo standing.</p>

    <h3>Elimination Mechanic</h3>
    <p>If one player in a duo is hit by a tissue, they are eliminated. The remaining partner must then stand and hold onto the eliminated playerâ€™s chair for 3 seconds.</p>

    <h3>Tissue Barrage</h3>
    <p>While the standing partner is holding the eliminated player's chair, other players may throw tissues at them. If the standing player is hit during this time, the entire duo is eliminated.</p>

    <h3>Winning Condition</h3>
    <p>The last surviving duo wins the round. The duo with the most eliminations or victories at the end of the tournament is declared the champion.</p>

  <section id="optional-house-rules">
    <h2>Optional House Rules</h2>
    <h3>Limited Ammo</h3>
    <p>Players are limited to a maximum of 3 tissues at a time. This forces players to use their shots strategically.</p>

    <h3>Speed Mode</h3>
    <p>In Speed Mode, players must throw tissues within a 5-second window after receiving them. This adds intensity and encourages quick reflexes.</p>

    <h3>Shield Rule</h3>
    <p>Players may hold one tissue as a shield but cannot throw it. The shield can be used to block incoming tissue attacks.</p>
